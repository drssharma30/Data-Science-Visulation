# Ans 25%





#Exercise 2. Distributions - 2
#In the murders dataset, the region is a categorical variable and to the right is its distribution.

#Which of the following is true:
# Ans The graph shows only four numbers with a bar plot.




# Exercise 3. Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (eCDF)
#The plot shows the eCDF for male heights:
  
 # Based on the plot, what percentage of males are shorter than 75 inches?
# Ans 95%





# Exercise 4. eCDF Male Heights
#The plot shows the eCDF for male heights:

# Ans 69 inches






#Exercise 5. eCDF of Murder Rates
